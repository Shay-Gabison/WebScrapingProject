## Introduction

The Web Scraping Project involves extracting information from websites and processing it for further analysis. The project showcases the use of various Python libraries for scraping and handling data, including `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pandas`.

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: Extract data from web pages.
- **Data Processing**: Clean and organize scraped data.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform basic analysis on the extracted data.
- **Export**: Save the processed data in various formats such as CSV or JSON.

## Installation

To set up the Web Scraping Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shay-Gabison/WebScrapingProject.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd WebScrapingProject
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies. You can use `pip` to install the necessary Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the web scraping scripts and analyze the data, follow these steps:

1. **Configure Scraping Targets**: Edit the configuration file or script to specify the URLs and data to be scraped.

2. **Run the Scraping Script**:
   ```bash
   python scrape_data.py
   ```

3. **Process the Scraped Data**:
   ```bash
   python process_data.py
   ```

4. **Analyze and Export Data**:
   ```bash
   python analyze_data.py
   ```

## Data

The project involves scraping data from specified websites. The structure of the scraped data and the formats in which it is saved can be customized according to the needs of the project.

- **Data Source**: URLs and target elements for scraping are defined in the configuration files or directly in the scripts.
- **Data Formats**: The scraped data can be exported to formats such as CSV or JSON.

## Scripts

- **`scrape_data.py`**: Script for scraping data from the web.
- **`process_data.py`**: Script for cleaning and organizing the scraped data.
- **`analyze_data.py`**: Script for analyzing and exporting the data.
